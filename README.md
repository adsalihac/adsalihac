## 🧠 About Me

I am a Mobile Architect and Product Engineering Lead with **10+ years of experience** in mobile development, including **6+ years specializing in high-scale React Native applications**.

I focus on building production-grade mobile systems that are:

- ⚡ Performance-optimized (TTR, FPS stability, bundle size)
- 🔐 Security-aligned (OWASP, SSL Pinning, Secure Storage, JWT)
- 🔁 CI/CD automated (GitHub Actions, Fastlane)
- 📊 Production-monitored (Crash reporting & analytics)
- 🏗️ Architected for long-term scalability

I don't just build apps, 
I build systems and teams that scale.
